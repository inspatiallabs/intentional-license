## Definitions

- **Licensor ("We")**: The party offering the Software under these Terms and Conditions, which is [COMPANY_NAME].

- **Software**: Each version of the software that [COMPANY_NAME] makes available under these Terms and Conditions, as indicated by the inclusion of these Terms and Conditions with the Software.

- **License Grant**: The rights granted by the Licensor to the Licensee to use, copy, modify, create derivative works, publicly perform, publicly display, and redistribute the Software.

- **Permitted Purpose**: Any purpose other than a Competing Use.

- **Competing Use**: Making the Software available to others in a commercial product or service that:
  1. substitutes for the Software;
  2. substitutes for any other product or service [COMPANY_NAME] offers using the Software that exists as of the date the Software is made available; or
  3. offers the same or substantially similar functionality as the Software.

- **Non-Commercial Use**: Use of the Software for purposes such as internal use and access, non-commercial education, non-commercial research, and in connection with professional services provided to a licensee using the Software in accordance with these Terms and Conditions, provided such use does not constitute a Competing Use.

- **Enterprise License**: A separate commercial agreement required for any use of the Software that constitutes a Competing Use, or for whitelabeling the Software.



## License Grant

Subject to your compliance with these Terms and Conditions, including the Patents, Redistribution, and Trademark clauses below, [COMPANY_NAME] hereby grants you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, non-sublicensable license to:

1. Use, reproduce, and distribute the Software for any Permitted Purpose.
2. Create derivative works of the Software for any Permitted Purpose.
3. Publicly perform and publicly display the Software for any Permitted Purpose.

## Permitted Purposes

A Permitted Purpose is any use of the Software that does not constitute a Competing Use. Specifically, Permitted Purposes include, but are not limited to:

- Using the Software for your internal operations and access within your organization.
- Using the Software for non-commercial educational purposes.
- Using the Software for non-commercial research activities.
- Using the Software in connection with professional services that you provide to a licensee, provided that such licensee uses the Software in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.

## Restrictions (Competing Use)

Notwithstanding the License Grant, any use of the Software that constitutes a Competing Use is strictly prohibited without obtaining a separate, valid Enterprise License from [COMPANY_NAME]. A Competing Use includes, but is not limited to, making the Software available to others as part of a commercial product or service that:

- Directly replaces or serves as an alternative to the Software itself.
- Directly replaces or serves as an alternative to any other product or service offered by [COMPANY_NAME] that utilizes the Software and exists at the time the Software is made available under this license.
- Provides functionality that is the same as or substantially similar to the Software.

Furthermore, whitelabeling the Software for commercial distribution or integration into a product or service offered to third parties also requires an Enterprise License.

## Patents

To the extent your use for a Permitted Purpose would necessarily infringe patents owned or controlled by [COMPANY_NAME], the license grant above includes a license under such patents. If you make a claim against any party that the Software infringes or contributes to the infringement of any patent, then your patent license to the Software granted under this license ends immediately.

## Redistribution

- Include a copy of or a prominent link to these Terms and Conditions.
- Not remove any copyright notices provided in or with the Software.
- Clearly indicate any modifications made to the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL [COMPANY_NAME] BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## Trademarks

Except for displaying the License Details and identifying [COMPANY_NAME] as the origin of the Software, you have no right under these Terms and Conditions to use our trademarks, trade names, service marks, or product names.

[COMPANY_NAME] hereby irrevocably grants you an additional license to use the Software under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "Apache License") that is effective on the first anniversary of the date [COMPANY_NAME] makes each specific version of the Software generally and/or publicly available. On or after that date, you may use that specific version of the Software under the Apache License, Version 2.0, but only for Non-Commercial Use. Full commercial use, including any Competing Use or whitelabeling, remains subject to obtaining a separate Enterprise License from [COMPANY_NAME].

Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at:

See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.

## Enterprise Licensing and Whitelabeling

For any use case that falls under the definition of a Competing Use, or for the purpose of whitelabeling the Software, a separate Enterprise License must be obtained from [COMPANY_NAME]. This Enterprise License will define the specific terms, conditions, and commercial arrangements for such uses, ensuring a fair and sustainable model for both [COMPANY_NAME] and its enterprise partners. Interested parties should contact [COMPANY_NAME] directly to discuss enterprise licensing options.

If your company or the entity using the Software has annual gross revenues exceeding $[REVENUE_THRESHOLD] USD (or equivalent in other currencies) in the most recent fiscal year, you must obtain an Enterprise License, regardless of whether your use constitutes a Competing Use.

If you discover you should have been using an Enterprise License, you have a 30-day grace period from discovery to obtain proper licensing without penalty, provided you disclose in good faith.

Licensing tiers and options can be found on the official website [WEBSITE_URL]

Unless you have an Enterprise License that waives this requirement, any application or service that incorporates any of the [PROJECT_NAME] core pipeline or Software must display "Powered by [PROJECT_NAME]" or similar attribution as seen on [PROJECT_NAME] Media Kit in a reasonably visible location (such as a splash screen, about dialog, or footer) in accordance with our attribution guidelines.
