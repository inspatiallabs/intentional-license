# Intentional License FAQ

## Comparison with Other Licenses

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **How does this relate to FSL (Functional Source License)?** | The Intentional License builds upon FSL's delayed open-source model but adds revolutionary decentralized governance. While FSL converts to Apache/MIT after 2 years with central control, we convert after 1 year with DAO-based community control. |
| **What makes this different from traditional open-source licenses?** | Traditional licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) are static and centrally controlled. The Intentional License is dynamic, governed by a DAO where contributors vote on changes, exceptions, and interpretations through blockchain smart contracts. |
| **How does this compare to Business Source License (BSL)?** | Both restrict commercial use initially, but BSL has a 4-year conversion period and no community governance. We have 1-year conversion, revenue thresholds, and full DAO control over license terms. |
| **Is this like Unity's licensing model?** | We borrowed the revenue threshold concept ($10m) but avoided controversial runtime fees. Unlike Unity's unilateral control, our community can vote to change thresholds and terms through the DAO. |

## General Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Do I need this license if I use the managed InSpatial platform?** | No. Managed platform users are automatically licensed based on their subscription plan. This license only applies to self-hosted installations. |
| **What is a "Competing Use"?** | Any commercial product/service that: (1) substitutes for InSpatial, (2) substitutes for InSpatial's commercial offerings, or (3) offers substantially similar functionality. |
| **When do I need an Enterprise License?** | You need one if: (1) your company has >$10m annual revenue, (2) you're making a Competing Use, or (3) you want to whitelabel the software. |
| **Can I use this for my startup?** | Yes! If your revenue is under $10m annually and you're not creating a competing product, you can use it freely with attribution. |
| **What's the "Powered by InSpatial" requirement?** | Non-enterprise users must display attribution in a visible location (splash screen, footer, about dialog). Enterprise licenses can waive this. |

## DAO Governance Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **How do I participate in governance?** | Get a verified account (1 vote weight) or contribute code. More accepted PRs = more governance weight, from Bronze (10+ PRs) to Diamond (100+ PRs). |
| **What can the DAO actually control?** | Everything from feature prioritization and PR acceptance to license terms, revenue thresholds, treasury allocation, and emergency security responses. |
| **How much voting weight do contributors get?** | General members: 1x, Active (5+ PRs): 2x, Bronze: 3x, Silver: 4x, Gold: 6x, Diamond: 8x, Core Maintainers: 10x, Founders: 15x |
| **Can the DAO change the license fundamentally?** | Yes, with high thresholds. License modifications require 1000 governance weight to propose and 30-day voting period. |
| **What prevents hostile takeover of the DAO?** | Weighted voting (founders/core maintainers have more weight), high proposal thresholds, and the ability to blacklist bad actors protect against attacks. |

## Technical Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Where is the DAO smart contract?** | Deployed on Solana at DAO ID: ##################################### |
| **Does the software phone home?** | It may collect anonymized telemetry for improvement and license compliance. Enterprise licenses can disable this. |
| **Can I modify and redistribute the code?** | Yes, for Permitted Purposes. You must include the license, preserve copyright notices, and indicate modifications. |
| **What happens after 1 year?** | That version becomes available under Apache 2.0 for non-commercial use. Commercial use still requires compliance with the Intentional License. |
| **Can I get the source code?** | The source is available to all. Enterprise Plus licenses may include additional access to private repositories and development branches. |

## Legal/Compliance Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What if I discover I should have had an Enterprise License?** | You have a 30-day grace period to obtain proper licensing without penalty if you disclose in good faith. |
| **Can InSpatial audit my usage?** | Yes, with reasonable notice for organizations that may require an Enterprise License. Non-compliance may result in retroactive fees. |
| **Is this OSI-approved open source?** | No. This is a source-available license that converts to open source (Apache 2.0) after 1 year for non-commercial use. |
| **Can I use this in government/healthcare/finance?** | Yes, but you'll likely need an Enterprise License due to revenue thresholds or specific compliance requirements. |
| **What warranty comes with the software?** | None. It's provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, as stated in the license disclaimer. |
