# Intentional License FAQ

## Comparison with Other Licenses

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|

| **What makes this different from traditional open-source licenses?** | Traditional licenses (MIT, Apache, GPL) are static and centrally controlled. The Intentional License is dynamic, governed by a DAO where contributors vote on changes, exceptions, and interpretations through blockchain smart contracts. |
| **How does this compare to Business Source License (BSL)?** | Both restrict commercial use initially, but BSL has a 4-year conversion period and no community governance. 


## General Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Do I need this license if I use the managed InSpatial platform?** | No. Managed platform users are automatically licensed based on their subscription plan. This license only applies to self-hosted installations. |
| **What is a "Competing Use"?** | Any commercial product/service that: (1) substitutes for InSpatial, (2) substitutes for InSpatial's commercial offerings, or (3) offers substantially similar functionality. |
| **When do I need an Enterprise License?** | You need one if: (1) your company has >$10m annual revenue, (2) you're making a Competing Use, or (3) you want to whitelabel the software. |
| **Can I use this for my startup?** | Yes! If your revenue is under $10m annually and you're not creating a competing product, you can use it freely with attribution. |
| **What's the "Powered by InSpatial" requirement?** | Non-enterprise users must display attribution in a visible location (splash screen, footer, about dialog). Enterprise licenses can waive this. |


## Commercial vs Non-Commercial Use

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What is Commercial Use?** | Any use where you or your organization derives financial benefit, including: selling products/services, SaaS offerings, internal business operations, consulting, or any revenue-generating activity. |
| **What is Non-Commercial Use?** | Use for personal projects, education, academic research, non-profit organizations (registered 501(c)(3) or equivalent), learning, experimentation, or contributing to open-source projects. |
| **Is internal use at my company commercial?** | Yes. Any use within a for-profit organization is commercial, even if not directly revenue-generating. This includes internal tools, dashboards, or development. |
| **My startup has no revenue yet - is that commercial?** | Yes. Intent to generate revenue makes it commercial use. However, you're free to use it if under the $10m revenue threshold and not competing. |
| **Can universities use this non-commercially?** | Yes, for teaching and academic research. But if the university commercializes research results or uses it for paid training, that's commercial use. |
| **What about hackathons and demos?** | Non-commercial if purely educational/experimental. Commercial if you're showcasing to investors or it's part of a business development process. |
| **Can non-profits use this freely?** | Registered non-profits can use it non-commercially. However, revenue-generating activities by non-profits (like selling services) may constitute commercial use. |




## Technical Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Does the software phone home?** | It may collect anonymized telemetry for improvement and license compliance. Enterprise licenses can disable this. |
| **Can I modify and redistribute the code?** | Yes, for Permitted Purposes. You must include the license, preserve copyright notices, and indicate modifications. |
| **What happens after 1 year?** | That version becomes available under Apache 2.0 for non-commercial use. Commercial use still requires compliance with the Intentional License. |
| **Can I get the source code?** | The source is generally available to all. Enterprise licenses may include additional access to private repositories and development branches. |

## Legal/Compliance Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What if I discover I should have had an Enterprise License?** | You have a 30-day grace period to obtain proper licensing without penalty if you disclose in good faith. |
| **Can InSpatial audit my usage?** | Yes, with reasonable notice for organizations that may require an Enterprise License. Non-compliance may result in retroactive fees. |
| **Is this OSI-approved open source?** | No. This is a source-available license that is more in line with the sustainable software model by [faircode](https://faircode.io/) which converts to open source (Apache 2.0) after 1 year for non-commercial use. |
| **Can I use this in government/healthcare/finance?** | Yes, but you'll likely need an Enterprise License due to revenue thresholds or specific compliance requirements. |
| **What warranty comes with the software?** | None. It's provided "AS IS" without warranties of any kind, as stated in the license disclaimer. |
